# 0x05-PYTHON-EXCEPTIONS

One of the craziest things I've come to love about Python is it's craziness and exceptions are one of those lttle points that make me love it.
Exceptions are messages, error messages that tell you that your piece of code is wrong, In pyhton, you are able to catch and handle these exceptions, by checking to see if such a message will occur, Thus doing, you handle errors and prevent your code from becoming exposed by malicious users. You are also free to raise an error, and stop the code if the user enters in the wrong ideas :joy:
