# 0X0A-PYTHON-INHERITANCE

Yay! I finally got my share of Dad's wealth. That's all that inheritance really does in python
Inheritance allows us to _share_ attributes, functions and methodsa from one class to another. The parent class shares or __gives__ his methods, attributes and the like to the child class.
But that's not all :laughing: Much like the prodigal son, the child class does whatever he wants with the attributes and methods he has been given. Once in a while he's the good boy and lets them be, using them as he found them. Other times, he overrides them and puts his own meanings into them. Pretty rebellious right.

Anyway, that's what this directory is all about: learning about inheritance in OOP and how to use it wisely. Pay close attention, you might meet it again when we start javascript
